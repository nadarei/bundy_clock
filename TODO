- update index page to dynamically load user records (do not hardcode)
- create TimeLog model, time_logs table
  - columns: date, in, out, user_id
  - belongs_to :user
  - update user 
- create Comment model, comments table
- TimeLog model has many comments (description)
- omniauth (alternative to authlogic using Google) 

TimeLogs
- get timelog of user for the day
  - @time_log = @user.time_logs.find_by_date(current_date)
  - or @time_log = TimeLog.new
  - ideally: user will have @user.current_time_log
- look for one-button submit helper
- update action in TimeLogsController
- review rails naming convention (controller names)
- save the time_log in create action
